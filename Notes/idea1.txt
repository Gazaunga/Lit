Crowds. The glorious utopia the system's parliament promised the citizens of Earth in the late 21st century all amounted to lines. Lines became crowds. The crowds were massive. Overpopulation was abundant.

What if Democratic-Liberal politicies went wild?

Educate everyone: overeducated population, gigantic low level work/service projects - doctors working construction, mining
-feed everyone: bread lines

*rewatch Adam Curtis

repopulation centers - traffice episode of doctor who
-fyre island kind of deal

social poverty - people are shamed into isolation fo rholding certain opinions

Science: because of artificial wombs + fertility drugs people with diseases/sickness/deformities can live and are more common
-Siames twins are more common, hermaphrodites, tails

Universal Healthcare: doesn't mean they can't decide what they put in your boyd in state hospitals

CULTURE:

Earth: very traditional, conservative, half the population of the system located on earth

Saturns Moons: 2nd largest population, lean (?) rich, business leaders, futurists, innovators, San Francisco, libertarian

Jupiter's Moons: bloated rich, neuvo riche, not CEOs, pseudo barony - they've been placated with soft power

Stations:

Life Boats:

Moons are sub-confederations of the main body of government
-the "government" of Jupiter is on a space station that's not always near Jupiter - shows off with maneuvers a lot

Saturn's ruling government and main commerce hub ('capitol') is a warship restyled to be a "research" yacht
-it does not leave Saturn's orbit

Earth + Luna - (have a private named alliance?) essential buffer relationship
-Luna has good relations with other moon governments
-very diplomatic - Luna government of negotiators
-closely tied with Earth - 2nd earliest colonists

Mars - first colonists, didn't go so well, they didn't want to come back. Mars is America.
-Unique system - congres (not parliament), regard moons + planets as one (don't recognize moon governments)
-krautrock philosophy - how can we be different

Kal - delivery pilot, new caravan pilot, his ricklessness as a pilot has worked in his favor. In a world of delays (MAJOR DELAYS) Kal is indispensable to those that hire him for contracts.
-he gets an extremely lucrative government contract despite his reckless success record

why didn't robots take over?

-emphasis was placed on the value of human workers, so much so that they have taken many menial robot jobs away to give them to people

-Without approval you will not be considered or classed as a business 
-there is a board of administrators who have training modules, experience markers, register etc
-if not, you're basically seen/treated as a hustler

*CONSPIRACY*
Alex Jones is Bill Hicks

after psyops agents find Bill Hicks to be dangerous they use a (now common, and banal) technology/technique on him to change him into a broadcast polemic that Kal listens to every day on his transport runs

Pigs everywhere. They're hearty so they were used as a food source/fuel source. Billions were proilferated. Pig ships. Special pigs that have different qualities for each planet/system/atmosphere.  Shit swamps from the waste have developed. Some were dispersed into space and form giant shit clouds (they're supposed to be launched toward stars, but not everyone complies).
