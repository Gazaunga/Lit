Scientists discover evidence for a habitable region within Saturn's moon Enceladus

Not only would it be incredibly difficult to get humans up there, much more so than Mars, but even once we get there we have serious problems. Just like Mars, we can solve many problems with electricity. We can create water and many chemicals, provide shelter and even ways to grow food. On Mars you can get electricity vs solar, which is perfectly doable. You can take some solar panels with you, over provision for damage, and build-out capacity over time. Saturn is too far for solar to be of any use. The only power source there is probably geothermal, unfortunately there's no lightweight way to convert geothermal energy into electricity. At least there isn't any that I'm aware of. This is quite a problem, as without electricity most modern conveniences cannot be bought. In fact, modern human life might be very difficult without electricity on a place that is not earth.

the hydrogen is best explained by chemical reactions between the moon's rocky core and warm water from its subsurface ocean. The SwRI-led team's discovery suggests that Enceladus' ocean floor could include features analogous to hydrothermal vents on Earth, which are known to support life on the seafloor.
"Hydrogen is a source of chemical energy for microbes that live in the Earth's oceans near hydrothermal vents,"

"Everything indicates that the hydrogen originates in the moon's rocky core," Waite said. "We considered various ways hydrogen could leach from the rock and found that the most plausible source is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials."
